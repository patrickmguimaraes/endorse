                                        While they are not legally required, terms and conditions set the stage for any successful business relationship. By making it clear and putting these guidelines in writing, business owners can avoid misunderstandings with their customers.

                                        Limitation of liability disclaimers is one of the main reasons why business owners take the time to include terms and conditions on their websites. When reasonable and drafted adequately, such clauses can help protect your business against claims and lawsuits and limit the amount of money that you would have to pay in damages.

You could expressly ask your users not to post anything that contains obscene language or any material that could be considered harmful or violent or infringes on someone else’s copyright.

This will help you make your website a safe space where people can feel comfortable sharing their opinions, which is especially important if you operate a news site, blog, or forum.

                                        From a business point of view, you could reserve the right to use the submitted content for marketing purposes which a lot of big box stores and eCommerce retailers do in order to promote products that get rave reviews. It’s important for your customers to know that you plan on doing so, otherwise they could be surprised to see their words or photo used in a commercial!
